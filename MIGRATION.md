# Migration provenance

WokCore starts from a clean repository rather than filtered WokRouter history.

The first runtime-code import will be reviewed separately. Its migration commit must record:

- the clean WokRouter source commit;
- every imported source and test path;
- renames into WokCore package boundaries;
- retained MIT attribution;
- verification results before and after extraction.

The private pre-rewrite recovery bundle is stored in WokDocs, not this public repository.
